**Use Pythagoras theorem**

a² + b² = c² 

r² + x² = (r+h)²

x² = (r+h)² - r²
 
6371² + x²   = (6371+0.09)²

40589641 + x² = (6371.09)²

x² = 40590787.7881 - 40589641

x² = 1146.7881

x   = 33.86 km 

***

d = √(r+h)² - r²

= √r² + 2rh + h² - r²

= √2rh + h²

***

Actually we can ignore h² because it is so small number that it won’t affect the result at all. Let’s try 

d = √2rh 

x = √2 x 6371 x 0.09

x = 33.86 km 

**The ship’s velocity is 60 km/h. Distance = 33.86 km** Find the time that takes the ship to get to the lighthouse.

***

Time = Distance/Speed 

= 33.86/60
        
( = 0.56 hour )

= 33.86 min  
       
=  33 min 52 sec 


**Answer**: The nearest distance from the ship to the lighthouse is 33.86 km and it will take the ship about 33 minutes and 52 seconds to get to there.
